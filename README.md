# System-Analysis-and-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client is DriverPass, a company that provides driving training to their customers. They offer driving lessons, schedule driving tests, and offer practice tests to their customers. DriverPass needs a system that will handle online classes, practice tests, and possibly on-the-road training for their customers. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I successfully identified functional and non-functional requirements and clearly described assumptions about the users or their technology and limitations of the system design. I also did a good job in creation of the UML diagrams. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I could have done better with the technical requirements. I would improve it by further analyzing technical requirements, like what hardware, infrastructure or operating system the system would need, or identifying what programming languages could be used to design the software for this system.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The purpose of designing an information system for a user is to meet all their needs and requirements. It's very important to know what the user really wants the system to do and how they intend to use it. That impacts the way we create the deliverable end product for them.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I would approach designing a software by first identifying the goals of the system and analyzing the client's needs and requirements. That is followed by system design and implementation where the executable software is developed. The final phase would be support and maintenance which would cover all future system's fixes, modifications or updates.
